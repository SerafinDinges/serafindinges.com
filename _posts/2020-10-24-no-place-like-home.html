A guided walk of roughly thirty minutes to rediscover your own neighbourhood in a new light. Applicable in any neighbourhood anywhere in the world. All you need is some headphones and your phone to play and pause the audio above. 


The audio walk was created by theatremaker and director (Megan Marie Griffith)[https://twitter.com/meganmegamegme] for a commission by (Niamos Arts Centre)[https://niamos.co.uk/starvin-artist] in Manchester. Megan wrote the script, we recorded her narration in my studio and I edited the audio and composed the bespoke soundtrack. Give it a listen!
