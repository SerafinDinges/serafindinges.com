In 2018 I was fascinated by the podcast S-Town, while co-incidentally also having to come up with a topic for my thesis, while I was studying Comparative Literature. As I was thinking, I realised that S-Town was basically utilising narrative structure that can already be found found in a lot of literature. I was wondering whether anyone had ever thought about the implications of making journalism more narrative (turns out they did. obviously). It got me thinking about tapping into our collective attention habits in order to make a journalistic story more appealing while also making sure that the listener still believes in the truth and journalistic merit of a story.

Anyway, some of that actually made it into the thesis. [You can look at it here.](/assets/docs/SerafinDinges_BAThesis.pdf) (It's in English)
