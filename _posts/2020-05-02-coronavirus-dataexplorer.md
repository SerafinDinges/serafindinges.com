    Data visualisation: Coronavirus So Meta!
# category: literature

I've spent some of my recent sparetime working on learning more about data visualisation. For this purpose I created a little tool to analyse data relating to Covid-19. It was mainly to teach myself how to use React with Recharts and transform data that was available open source. 

I have said it before and I will say it again. I am incredibly thankful for data analysts that can really nerd out over data and make accessible publicly. (Shoutout to the Office for National Statistics in the UK!)

You can look at what I've done with the project on this  website: [someta.xyz](https://someta.xyz)
