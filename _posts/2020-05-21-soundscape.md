    Ambient storytelling experiment

I've been meaning to spend some time improving my soundscaping skills for podcast scoring. So I set myself the challenge to create an abstract little story just from ambient music and sounds recorded around my flat. This is the result.

I used Ableton Live which I'm still getting to know, but I'm loving the effortless Midi integration. If you have any use for the soundscape, I'm happy to provide it for free â€“ just [get in touch](mailto:hi@serafindinges.com).
